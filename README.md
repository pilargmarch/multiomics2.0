This is the repository for my Master's Final Thesis.

## :dna: [Data](data/)
RNA-Seq, miRNA-Seq, methylation and proteomics data used in this project, both as raw and cooked.

---

## :computer: [Scripts](scripts/)
Final `.R` scripts used to generate the obtained results.

### 🍳 [Preprocessing](scripts/preprocessing/)

## 🗺️ [Reports](reports/)

Exploratory `.Rmd` notebooks (knitted as `.md`) used to decide which pipelines to follow in the final scripts.
