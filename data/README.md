# :dna: Data

Since the data files are too large to store on GitHub, here is the structure of the data folder with direct links to said files stored in [this MEGA folder](https://mega.nz/folder/Kl8h1LJJ#oactgNw1q3Wwu5qZaLdnkA). All data was downloaded with R/Bioconductor package `TCGAbiolinks` using Harmonized mode, which prepares data in a different way to Legacy (e.g. using `STAR` counts instead of `RSEM` estimated counts in the case of RNA-Seq) and aligns reads against human assembly GRCh38 (hg38). `.rda` files can be directly loaded into R. `.RDS` files need to be read using the `readRDS` R function.

*Note: some omics appear to have more samples than others, but this is just because some samples (normal tissue; or tumor samples) were analyzed twice, using the same aliquot. In practice we'll merge the data in these cases.

## ü•© Raw data

### :one: RNA-Seq

`RangedSummarizedExperiment` objects generated by `TCGAbiolinks` containing (among other information) `unstranded`, `stranded_first`, `stranded_second`, `tpm_unstrand`, `fpkm_unstrand` and `fpkm_uq_unstrand` counts for 60,660 genes. `Unstranded` counts were used.

- **[RNA.with.prot.rda (402.5 MB)](https://mega.nz/file/bwcziAyJ#2VD9WB_BI2QzTZe2F9MPp4668GwgOcVCcx_Gcxd6am4)**: with data for only 650 of the previous samples that have data for proteomics as well.

### :two: miRNA-Seq

Data frames generated by `TCGAbiolinks` with `read_counts`, `reads_per_million_miRNA_mapped` and `cross-mapped` counts for 1,881 miRNAs. `read_counts` were used.

- **[miRNA.with.prot.rda (2.8 MB)](https://mega.nz/file/3oNz0YJB#1x7V9HsVXdCPCBMpe1kVpX6OdVqq8y1B2jOnDJKj4iA)**: with data for only 489 of the previous samples.

### :three: Methylation

`RangedSummarizedExperiment` objects generated by `TCGAbiolinks` containing (among other information) methylation beta-values for 485,577 CpG islands obtained by mapping HM450 probes to the GRCh38 reference genome.

- **[met.rda (2.7 GB)](https://mega.nz/file/C0N3TaRb#CJmugJQ6-4OeKDhRXG4qxlubuvepJ7Nt1eYRtXSHED8)**: with data for 857 samples.

### :four: Proteomics

Data frame generated by `TCGAbiolinks` with quantified protein expression for 487 peptide targets.

- **[prot.rda (2 MB)](https://mega.nz/file/78d2yTJZ#JwJG9bAUJ_Uo2WPRfWH2wiK4gy0KZ1TdhdMDdk8TqrY)**: with data for 643 samples.

## üçñ Cooked

### :one: RNA-Seq

Raw counts were first filtered by setting a CPM threshold of 0.5 and a cv.cutoff of 500 with R/Bioconductor package `NOISeq`. These filtered counts were then normalized with R/Bioconductor `cqn` by correcting for sample-specific gene GC-content and length biases, as well as for between-sample effects.

- **[RNA.filt.rda (35.5 MB)](https://mega.nz/file/i813Ba6Z#uh6fPQhLueQO3DvU1Hy4YkGBIiEkQBmxCqSETStBhRw)**: raw filtered counts for 19,318 genes.

- **[RNA.norm.Factors.rda (124.2 MB)](https://mega.nz/file/T5k3wKCa#jlB3Azyny_IIXHTEAQTAr0ZMyRpXzTAnhJcmqRRzUlY)**: normalization factors obtained with `cqn`. 

- **[RNA.norm.rda (354 MB)](https://mega.nz/file/v4tUVBLR#FSnFyqTTLKvw3rAEsYG5wi5sLQW7yJ0ZxN2bxB9y3U0)**: normalized expression matrix obtained with `cqn`. 

### :two: miRNA-Seq

Raw counts were first filtered by setting a CPM threshold of 0.5 and a cv.cutoff of 500 with R/Bioconductor package `NOISeq`. These filtered counts were then normalized with R/Bioconductor `EDASeq` by correcting for sample-specific gene GC-content bias, as well as for between-sample effects.

- **[miRNA.filt.rda (719.2 kB)](https://mega.nz/file/20slWQCS#U-nGNr3KFCxFEEiMlNKFYnBD8L1lhYR4jZMrz7jtuxU)**: raw filtered counts for 491 miRNAs.

- **[miRNA.norm.Factors.rda (3 MB)](https://mega.nz/file/jt0XzawA#lHpPADqjwIMzZzaKMLRP14lcuk9zCZpFzPK1R4mTJUM)**: normalization factors obtained with `EDASeq`.

### :three: Methylation

Probes that had any NA's were removed, as well as probes with all 0 values (of which there were none in this case). 

- **[bval.RDS (2.5 GB)](https://mega.nz/file/619BkKoA#UqsLWZPuw8qLdYxaj45DLmlTXlA_G3qxAEEtzdvaGqA)**: filtered methylation beta-values for 364,019 CpG sites.
